    We set the mask plane indicated by ``crosstalkStr`` in a target amplifier
    for pixels in a source amplifier that exceed `minPixelToMask`. Note that
    the correction is applied to all pixels in the amplifier, but only those
    that have a substantial crosstalk are masked with ``crosstalkStr``.

    The uncorrected image is used as a template for correction. This is good
    enough if the crosstalk is small (e.g., coefficients < ~ 1e-3), but if it's
    larger you may want to iterate.

    This method needs unittests (DM-18876), but such testing requires
    DM-18610 to allow the test detector to have the crosstalk
    parameters set.

    exposure : `lsst.afw.image.Exposure`
        Exposure for which to subtract crosstalk.
    crosstalkCoeffs : `numpy.ndarray`

    minPixelToMask : `float`

    crosstalkStr : `str`
